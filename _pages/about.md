About me
======
I am a first-year PhD at the [University of Michigan EECS](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qing Qu](https://qingqu.engin.umich.edu/). Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from [Tsinghua University](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in automation.
I collaborated with Prof. [Li Yi](https://ericyi.github.io/) and Prof. [Wenkai Lu](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1078/3204.htm).

Research
======
My research centers on understanding and advancing deep neural networks through low-dimensional modeling (and other first principles). I'm particularly interested in diffusion models and multimodal LLMs, and their potential applications in scientific domains
